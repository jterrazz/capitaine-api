## Get Started üçã

### Quick Start with Docker

Getting started with our API is simple! We use **docker** to manage the application and its dependencies. If you haven't installed Docker yet, you can follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to set it up.

To launch the project, use the following command:

```sh
# Start the project
sh ./scripts/docker.sh start
```

With this quick setup, you'll be ready to explore the power of our Open Market API and build seamless experiences for customers. Happy coding!
To help you **develop**, we provide a few scripts to run the project with hot reload, and run tests.

```sh
# Develop the project with hot reload
sh ./scripts/docker.sh start:dev

# Run tests
sh ./scripts/docker.sh test
```

### Quick start with Node.js

If you want to run the project locally, you will need to install the following dependencies:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Since this project requires external services (database, etc), you will need to run them manually.

```sh
sh ./scripts/docker.sh start:infra
```

#### Start the project

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the project
yarn start

# Develop the project with hot reload
yarn start:dev
```

#### Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```

## Code quality üèó

### Tests

The **`jest` framework** is used to run both **integration** (`/tests/e2e/*.test.ts`) and **unit** tests (`__tests__/*.test.ts`).
The tests are run on **Github Actions** on each push.

### Linting

The **`eslint` framework** is used to lint the code. The rules are defined in the `.eslintrc` file.
